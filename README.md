Hi I’m Michael! I’m an industry veteran currently working on [InfluxDB Edge](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb),
InfluxData’s new open source time series database. Prior to InfluxData I’ve worked at companies like
[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), where I built out their Compute@Edge platform for running code all
around the world close to your users and Commure, where I worked on building out systems to enable better
interoperability among healthcare systems and hospitals. While I’ve mainly specialized in networking,
back end systems, and Rust over the past 8+ years I’m always driven to learn more and expand my breadth of knowledge.
