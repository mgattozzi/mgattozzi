## About Me

I am an experienced Software Developer with a proven track record of 8 years in the industry. Throughout my career, I have primarily focused on leveraging my expertise in Rust, but I am equally enthusiastic about other languages such as Go, Python, Java and JavaScript to name a few. My passion lies in delivering exceptional experiences to end-users through my work. Outside of the professional sphere, I find great joy in nature, often indulging in activities like hiking, gardening, and nurturing my bonsai collection, which provide a refreshing balance to my life and work.
